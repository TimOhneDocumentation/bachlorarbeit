Progress in particle physics has always been driven by the desire to understand the fundamental building blocks of our universe.
\newline Our best theory for the innnerworkings of our world,
the standart model of particle physics shows us, that the matter we see around us is mostly made up of up and down qurks,
who together form protons and neutrons.
These particles are the nuclei of the atoms that make up the world around us. 
 The Proton unlike the electron or the quraks is not a fundamental particle, 
and thus has a charge radius. 
\newline
The Amber experiment at CERN aims to reselove a discrepency between the radius of the proton as measured by the Lamb shift in muonic and ordinary hydrogen and the electron scattering experiments,
the so called proton radius puzzel.
