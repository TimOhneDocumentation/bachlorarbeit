The AMBER experiment at CERN aims to measure the proton radius by scattering muons on protons.
The scintillating fiber hodoscope (SFH) is a key component of the PRM experiment, providing high precision time measurements of the incoming and scattered muons.
The frontend electronics of the SFH, responsible for the detector readout, is FPGA-based and utilize the Citiroc1A ASIC for signal processing.
\newline
I developed the FPGA firmware for the control and readout of the Citiroc1A ASIC of the frontend electronics of the SFH.
\newline
I performed a threshold scan in order to characterize the frontend electronics and test the developed firmware.
\newline
The detailed structure of the firmware and the full characterization of the frontend electronics are presented in this thesis.
\newline
I conclude that the developed firmware is capable of controlling and reading out the signals from the Citiroc1A ASIC,
but that the frontend electronics are currently not performing as desired.
I propose further research and steps to investigate and understand the behaviour of the frontend electronics of the scintillating fiber hodoscope and complete it's development.
