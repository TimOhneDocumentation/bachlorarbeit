The proton radius measurement (PRM) experiment at AMBER at CERN aims to measure the proton radius by scattering muons on protons.
The scintillating fiber hodoscope (SFH) is a key component of the PRM experiment, providing essential time measurements of the incoming and scattered muons.
In this thesis, the development of the FPGA-driven frontend electronics of the SFH is presented,
focusing on the development of the FPGA firmware required for the control and readout of the Citiroc1A ASIC, a crucial part of the readout and trigger electronics.
We conclude that the developed firmware is capable of controlling and reading out the signals from the Citiroc1A ASIC,
but that the frontend electronics are currently not prforming as desired.
We propose further reasearch and steps to investigate and understand the behaviour of the frontend electronics of the scintillating fiber hodoscope and complete it's development.
