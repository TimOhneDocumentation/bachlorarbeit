\section{Measurment of the Charge Radius of the Proton (PRM)}\label{sec:proton_radius}
The proton is a baryon, a composite particle made up of one down quark and two up quarks.
From this follows that the proton is not a point particle, but has an internal sturucture.\autocite{Workman:2836514}
\newline
The internal structure can be described by the structure functions of the proton, 
the electric and magnetic form factors $G_E$ and $G_M$.\autocite{ProposalAmber}	
\subsection{Previous Measurements of the Proton Radius}

\end{figure}

The charge radius of the proton has been measured several times before with different methods.
The two premier methods are electron proton scattering experiments and the Lamb shift in muonic and ordinary hydrogen.
The results of these measurements differ by five standard deviations as shown in Figure \ref{fig:previous_proton_radius},
this has given rise to the so called proton radius puzzle.\autocite{ProposalAmber}

\subsection{Elastic Scattering of Muons on Protons}
The AMBER PRM experiment at CERN aims to help reslove the proton radius puzzle, by measuring the elastic scattering of muons on protons.
The first order cross section, taking into account only interactions where one virtual photon was exchanged, 
for the elastic scattering of muons on a proton target is 
%INSERT: maybe  here more explantation 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:cross_section}
\frac{d\sigma}{dQ^2} = \frac{\pi \alpha^2}{Q^4 m_p^2 p_\mu^2} \bigg[ \left( G_E^2 + \tau G_M^2 \right) \frac{ 4E_\mu^2 m_p^2 
- Q^2 (s - m_\mu^2)}{1 + \tau }  - G_M^2 \frac{ 2m_\mu^2 Q^2 - Q^4}{2} \bigg]
\end{equation}
with  $Q^2 = -q^2$ 	the squared transferred four-momentum, $\tau = Q^2 / 4m_p^2$, $s = (p_\mu + p_p)^2$, 
 $G_E$ the electric form factor of the proton,
  $G_M$ the magnetic form factor of the proton and $\alpha$ the fine structure constant.\autocite{intentAmber}
Through determining the form factor $G_E$ for small $Q^2$ , the charge radius of the Proton can be claculated with the following equation\autocite{intentAmber}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:charge_radius}
r_p^2 = -6 \frac{dG_E}{dQ^2} \bigg|_{Q^2 = 0}
\end{equation}
Since the cross section can not be measured at $Q^2 = 0$, the form factors $G_E$ and $G_M$ have to be extrapolated to $Q^2 = 0$.
This is done by fitting the form factors to the experimental data and then extrapolating to $Q^2 = 0$.\autocite{intentAmber}
\section{General Setup for PRM at AMBER.}\label{sec:general_setup}
\subsection{Detectors for PRM}

To determine the magentic $G_M$ and electric form $G_E$ factors of the proton and thus the charge radius of the Proton,
the experimental cross section of the elastic scattering of muons on protons has to be measured.
The general setup of the PRM experiment, with focus on the new detectors needed for the proton radius measurment, is shown in Figure \ref{fig:amber_setup}.
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[angle=-90,origin=c,width=0.85\textwidth]{NEWPRMsetup.pdf}
	\caption{General setup of the Amber experiment with new detectors for PRM.\autocite{InternalcommunicationKarl}}
	\label{fig:amber_setup}
\end{figure}
The incoming muon beam with an energy of \SI{100} {\giga\electronvolt}\autocite{ProposalAmber} and an beam rate of $2 \times 10^6$\autocite{ConfrancePaperDAQ} particles per second is scattered on a pressurized hydrogen gas target,
located in the Time Projection Chamber (TPC), 
which also acts as the detector for the recoil path of the scattered proton.
\newline
The reconstruction of the path of the muon is achieved through the usage of two detector types,
combined into one unified tracking station (UTS) as shown in Figure \ref{UTSpicture}.
\newline
Each UTS consists of three layers of pixilized silicon detectors (ALPIDEs), for precise positional measurments (spacial resolution of about 8 Âµm\autocite{Amber2022Status}) of the incoming and scattered muons, 
but they lack, with their time uncertainty of \SI{5} {\micro\second}\autocite{Amber2022Status} the required time resolution for the PRM experiment.
For this reason each UTS includes a scintillating fiber hodoscope (SFH), the detector of interest for this thesis,
which provides the time precision(\SI{300} {\pico\second}\Autocite{Amber2022Status}) for the measurment.
\newline
Four of these unified tracking stations, two before and two after the active target, are placed in the beamline as shown in Figure \ref{fig:amber_setup}.
The measurment of the momentum of the scattered moun is done by existing COMPASS detectors located after the, 
for the PRM newly included, detectors\autocite{ProposalAmber}.

\subsection{Scintillating Fiber Hodoscope(SFH)}

	\caption{Scintillating fiber hodoscope (SFH) with two of the four layers of scintillating fibers installed. The frontend electronics are not attached.\autocite{InternalcommunicationKarl}}
	\label{SFHpicture}
\end{figure}
The scintillating fiber hodoscope shown in Figure \ref{SFHpicture}, 
the detector for which the FPGA driven frontend electronics are developed in this thesis,
is used to measure the precise timing(\SI{300}{\pico\second}\Autocite{Amber2022Status}) of the incoming and scattered muons. 
Every SFH contains four layers of scintillating fibers, two in x and two in y direction.
Each layer is made up of 192\autocite{Amber2022Status}, 500 $\mu m$ thick\autocite{Amber2024Status} fibers, in total 768\autocite{Amber2022Status} fibers per SFH. 
When charged particels, muons in this case, pass through a scintillating fiber they excite the scintillating material, 
which then emits photons. Both ends of every fiber are connected to a silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) which converts the photons into an electrical signal,
that is then proccesed by the frontend electronics. To minimize cost and the amount of data that has to be processed, a mirrored readout is planned, 
where only one end is connected to the SiPM array and the other end is mirrored.\autocite{InternalcommunicationKarl}

\section{Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA)}\label{sec:FPGA}
Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are integrated circuits that can be programmed after manufacturing.
FPGA are made up of a grid of programmable logic blocks (PLBs) and programmable interconnects.
They posses the advantage of beeing flexible, reconfigurable and beeing able to process large amounts of data in parallel.
The frontend electronics for the SFH reqiure large amounts of data to be processed in real time, which makes FPGAs with their large data throughput and parallel processing capabilities ideal for this task.\autocite{FPGA_reviewDSP}
\newline
The FPGA used in the frontend electronics for the scintillating fiber hodoscope is part of the Xilinx Artix-7 family.\autocite{InternalcommunicationIgor}
